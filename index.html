    <h1>What is Storage</h1>
    <p>Storage in a computer or mobile device is the hardware component responsible for retaining and retrieving digital data, such as files, programs, and the operating system itself. It functions as the device's long-term memory, ensuring that data persists even when the power is turned off.  Essentially, every piece of information that makes a device function—from your photos and documents to the code that runs your apps—is housed in storage. Its capacity, usually measured in gigabytes (GB) or terabytes (TB), dictates how much information the device can permanently hold.</p>
    <p>Computer and mobile devices utilize two main types of storage: Primary Storage (often referred to as memory, specifically RAM) and Secondary Storage (the persistent disk). Primary Storage (RAM) is ultra-fast but volatile, meaning it only holds data—like the active program you are currently using—while the device is powered on. When you close an app or turn off the device, RAM is cleared. Secondary Storage, such as a Solid State Drive (SSD) in modern devices or a Hard Disk Drive (HDD) in older computers, is non-volatile. This is the permanent location where your operating system, installed apps, and personal files are saved and remain safe until you choose to delete them.</p>
    <p>The choice and speed of secondary storage significantly impact a device's performance. In modern mobile devices and computers, SSDs have largely replaced older HDDs because they use flash memory chips with no moving parts, resulting in vastly faster boot times, quicker application loading, and overall snappier performance. When you launch an application, the operating system copies the program files from the slow, large-capacity secondary storage (SSD/HDD) into the fast, temporary primary storage (RAM) so the CPU can access the information instantly. Therefore, both types of storage must work together: the permanent drive for persistence and the temporary RAM for speed and active processing.</p>
